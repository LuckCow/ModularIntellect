## Introduction
Large language models show great promise in their abilities as a cognitive engine. Through a wide range of individual tasks, they show human level performance. On their own, however, they are still lacking a fundamental component of an intelligent agent: long term memory. Long term memory will allow the agent to load in relevant information for a given task and also retain and iterate on tasks done in the past. The key challenge with setting up long term memory for a language model to use is searching the memory to find relevant information. Semantic search is a proven way to accomplish this: we can encode the query into a high dimensional semantic space and find information from memory that are mathematically within that space. This can work very well in simple cases, but sometimes further searching needs to be done to fully answer the question. The graph traversal memory system presented here expands upon semantic search by presenting the large language model with context information via semantic search but also allowing it to look up further information by traversing a graph database.

## Methods
### Graph Traversal
In order to create a graph database that is also capable of being used for semantic search, I decided to combine Neo4j with FAISS. Neo4j is a graph database that persists the actual data with a unique identifier (UUID) for each chunk of data. FAISS is a library that enables efficient semantic search, meaning it stores a group of vectors and their associated UUIDs and it can be given a new query vector and find the most similar stored vectors to that vector. Each vector here represents the semantic encoding of the peice of textual information. Whenever information is stored in the databse, it also must be semantically encoded which means that a neural network (Open AI's `text-embedding-ada-002` in this case) converts the text into a high dimensional vector which groups thin gs with similar meanings together. When it comes time to lookup similar information, the query is embedded into the vector space and used to lookup similar information via FAISS which returns the UUIDs, which can be used to get the full document in Neo4j. 

In order for the language model to understand how to use the graph database, I constructed a prompt describing what it was being presented with and how to look up more information. Initially, the language model is presented a number of document chunks that are most relevant to the user's query. With each chunk is included each of the graph database connections to that chunk. The language model can then choose to lookup any of these chunks to repeat the process until it no longer wants to look up more information. With each chunk looked up, it is also asked to determine if the chunk is relevant and give a summary of it if it is. Finally, it is asked to build up a working summary, which will be used as the answer at the end of the process. The full code of the memory system and prompt chain are available in this repository.

### Knowledge Base Data
For this example, the knowledge base has been populated with 11 of my favorite AI papers. They are all cited at the bottom of this page. The process for loading the documents is as follows: for each document in a directory, read the pdf, break it into chunks, encode the chunk using an embedding model and store it in the graph database and vector index. For this example, I used a chunk size of 1000 characters with an overlap of 200 characters between chunks. For this example, I used Open AI's `text-embedding-ada-002` text embedding


## Results
To roughly gauge the effectiveness of the graph traversal memory system, I present a comparison between 3 scenarios where different components are removed to attempt to demonstrate how much each addition to the system effected the final result. The 3 scenarios are: 1. semantic search with graph traversal, 2. no graph traversal, and 3. no semantic search or graph traversal. The same question is posed in each scenario and the responses are presented below.

Question: `What are some techniques for achieving better general intelligence in language models?`

For this example, all responses were generated using GPT4. The final answer for each method is shown below and the full prompt chain is included in the appendix at the bottom of this page.

### 1. Semantic search with graph traversal follow up
Here is the result of both the semantic search with graph traversal combined. This demonstrates the usage of the semantic search to find the most relevant chunks to the question and then it made a lookup request to gather more information from a connected chunk to better answer the question. On the first iteration, the language model was presented the information of chunks 1, 4, 7, and 10. It found 1 to be useful, and the rest to not be relevant, so it made a working summary of chunk 1 and requested to look up chunk 2 which continues from chunk 1. On the second iteration, it completed its summarization of chunk 2 and requested no additional connections, ending the iteration with the working summary which included information from chunks 1 and 2.
#### Answer (GPT4 + Graph Traversal + Semantic Search)
Some techniques for achieving better general intelligence in language models include prepending a question with related question-answer pairs, adding natural language instructions before example pairs, using chain of thought prompting for multi-step reasoning tasks, least to most prompting for complex reasoning questions, and language model cascades for processing model outputs and feeding them as inputs to subsequent language model calls.

# 2. Semantic Search Only
Here, I provide the same context information given by vector search without the ability to traverse the graph. It does pretty well here, but it is limited by what the semantic search pulls up first. It was unable to further dig into the graph to find more information, resulting in a less complete answer. Specifically, the difference is that it does not mention "least to most prompting" like the above answer did because it was not included in the first context chunk, but only the second one which was looked up by the graph traversal process.
. Another difference is that it is a longer answer. This is likely because the language model expected that the working summary of the traversal process should be kept brief whereas here it knew to give the final answer in one go. A final answer prompting step could be introduced to the graph traversal process in order specify the desired format and level of detail of the answer.

#### Answer (GPT4 + Semantic Search)
Several techniques can be used to enhance the general intelligence of language models. These include the use of related (question, answer) pairs and prepending these pairs with a natural language instruction to improve question-answering accuracy. Chain of thought prompting, which involves multi-step reasoning, also enhances the model's ability to answer questions. Furthermore, memory augmentation, which involves using context-target pairs and aggregating them to calculate the next-token probability, can also be beneficial. However, it's important to consider existing limitations, such as the fixed length of input strings in transformer-based models, with recent research investigating methods to overcome this through chaining multiple calls to a language model.

### 3. No semantic search or graph traversal
Here, I simply ask the question without providing context to see what the model inherently knows on the topic. The model gives some decent general answers, but it isn't based on the latest research which I am more interested in. This is ofcourse because it has not been trained on this research. Even if it has, it is still not going to be a great answer because it is not based on specific factual information. Also, it offered a bullet point list of techniques instead of in paragraph form. This was probably because the additional context provided by the above prompts indicated that the answer should be in paragraph form whereas here it was free to choose on its own without that contextual influence.

#### Answer (GPT4)
Better general intelligence in language models can be achieved through various techniques. Here are some key strategies:

    More Training Data: Increasing the amount and diversity of data can lead to better understanding and handling of a wider variety of topics, languages, dialects, and cultures. This allows a language model to understand and generate more nuanced responses.

    Better Training Algorithms: Improving the algorithms used to train language models can also enhance their capabilities. Novel architectures, better optimization techniques, or improved learning rules can make language models more effective.

    Transfer Learning: This technique involves training a model on a large, general dataset, and then fine-tuning it on a smaller, more specific dataset. This can help the model generalize from common language use to more specific applications.
...

Implementing these strategies could lead to substantial improvements in the general intelligence of language models. It's important to note that research in this area is very active, and new techniques are continually being developed.

## Further Work
I would like to establish a more rigorous testing methodology to better compare the effectiveness of different memory systems. There are a lot of work being done on benchmarking for large language models, but utilizing memory is an additional complexity that is not usually addressed. Something like the AP English Literature free response questions about analysing an entire book is along the right lines. It is good because there are many examples of questions and responses out there, but there is still the problem that the process is not automated due to it being a freeform response.

Additionally, I will continue to expand on the memory system. I think that a graph database based knowledge system is a great fit for language models since they can easily understand the concept of connections, allowing them to be presented with the information and make decisions about what to look up based on the connection information. I plan on adding additional data beyond documents to the graph knowledge base. Each question and answer will be recorded as a conversation node into the database so that they can also be referenced like the documents. Additionally, the language model will be prompted to make internal thoughts by presenting related context information and be asked to synthesize connections between the information (inspired by 'reflections' in Park, Joon Sung, et al [2023]). These internal thoughts will also be persisted, allowing the system to construct abstract thoughts based on other thoughts to hopefully achieve a deeper level of intelligence though complex thinking.

SystemMessage: Act as a researcher trying to answer a question about a topic. You have access to a knowledge base of documents broken down into context chunks that are connected to eachother.
Information will be presented to you with a small number of chunks at a time. Each chunk of information may or may not be relevant to the question.
Additionally, each context chunk also has connection references to other chunks that are not immediately presented, but can be accessed by requesting to lookup the chunk referenced by the connection.
For each chunk that you are presented with, list out the chunk number, then evaluate whether or not the chunk is relevant to the question. If the chunk is relevant, provide a summary of the relevant information in the chunk, otherwise, just put 'None'
Then, give the best answer you can with the information that you have so far.
Finally, reflect on that answer and decide if it can be improved by looking up additional information from the connections. If so, list out any of the connections that you think would help improve the answer.
For example, if you are presented a chunk that seems like it is about to have important information to answer the question,
 but stops and has a connection that "CONTINUES TO" another chunk, you can respond by saying: "LOOKUP CONTEXT CHUNK #<chunk id>".
For example, your answer should follow this format:
"Chunk Review:

Summary Chunk #1:
Some techniques for achieving better general intelligence in language models include the use of related (question, answer) pairs to improve question answering accuracy. Adding a natural language instruction before these example pairs can enhance the capabilities of the model. Another technique is the "chain of thought prompting", which has been shown to improve question answering ability in scenarios where multiple reasoning steps are required. However, limitations exist as current transformer-based models can only condition on an input string of a fixed length. Recent works are exploring techniques for chaining multiple calls to a language model by processing model outputs.

Summary Chunk #4:
Memory augmentation is another technique used to improve language models. In this approach, memory is considered as a set of context-target pairs. These pairs can be aggregated to calculate the next-token probability, weighted by the similarity between hidden representations.

```text
Act as a researcher trying to answer a question about a topic. Use what you know about the topic already to answer the question concisely and factually. Question: What are some techniques for achieving better general intelligence in language models?

response>>>>>>>>
Better general intelligence in language models can be achieved through various techniques. Here are some key strategies:

    More Training Data: Increasing the amount and diversity of data can lead to better understanding and handling of a wider variety of topics, languages, dialects, and cultures. This allows a language model to understand and generate more nuanced responses.

    Better Training Algorithms: Improving the algorithms used to train language models can also enhance their capabilities. Novel architectures, better optimization techniques, or improved learning rules can make language models more effective.

    Transfer Learning: This technique involves training a model on a large, general dataset, and then fine-tuning it on a smaller, more specific dataset. This can help the model generalize from common language use to more specific applications.

    Multi-task Learning: In this approach, a model is trained on multiple tasks simultaneously, encouraging it to learn representations that are useful across a variety of tasks. This can improve generalization and robustness.

    Incorporation of External Knowledge: Language models can be augmented with external knowledge bases to provide them with factual information. This can help improve the accuracy and usefulness of the model's outputs.

    Improved Evaluation Metrics: Better evaluation metrics can help us understand the true capabilities and limitations of our models. Improved metrics can guide research towards areas that need the most improvement.

    Interactive Learning: This involves iterative feedback between humans and models, allowing the models to learn and adjust over time. This can make them more responsive to users' needs and improve their performance.

    Combining Model-based and Data-driven approaches: Traditional AI methods like rule-based systems or expert systems can be combined with data-driven machine learning methods to leverage the advantages of both.

    Explainability and Interpretability: Working on the transparency of models helps to understand the model's decision-making process. This can lead to more informed updates and iterations to the model.

    Federated Learning: This is a machine learning approach that allows for data to remain on its original device, and only model updates are shared between the server and the devices. This can help in scaling up the learning process with privacy preservation.

Implementing these strategies could lead to substantial improvements in the general intelligence of language models. It's important to note that research in this area is very active, and new techniques are continually being developed.
